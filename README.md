- 👋 Hi, I’m @N0probllama,

- 👀 I’m interested in a variety of hobbies ranging from visual arts to multi-day backcountry trips in remote wilderness. I enjoy using QGIS for cartography, and use my own maps and GPS data for wilerness navigation and work projects.

- 🌱 I’m a Forest Technologist and Environmental Technologist who is upgrading my skills to learn web development with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I'm also learning Java!

- 💞️ I’m looking to improve my skills with a positive and supportive community.

- 📫 Stay tuned for more content to come!
