- 👋 Hi, I’m @N0probllama,

- 👀 I’m interested in a variety of hobbies ranging from visual arts to multi-day backcountry trips in remote wilderness. I enjoy using QGIS for cartography, and make my own geo-referanced maps for backcountry navigation. (Yes, that's my dog! Her name is Zelda)

- 🌱 I’m a current Computer Science student with a previous education in Forest Technology and Environmental Technology. I am upgrading my skills to learn Java, web development with HTML5, CSS3 and also Javascript.

- 💞️ I’m looking to improve my skills with a positive and supportive community.

- 📫 Stay tuned for more content to come!
